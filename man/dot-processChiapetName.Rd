\title{Function to process names relating to interactions stored in bed12 formats.}
\usage{
.processChiapetName(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of names stored in the bed file}
}
\value{
a data.frame containing all of the processed information
}
\description{
In bed(n) formats interaction data cannot be stored directly due to the inability of the format to handle
trans-interactions. It is only capable of storing cis-interactions through the use of blockStarts and blockEnds.
As such the information is typically stored as a string of the format chr1:start1..end1-chr2:start2..end2,N
(e.g. \"chr1:3268539..3269061-chr10:103124111..103124631,4\".). This function takes a vector of these strings
and converts them to a data.frame.
