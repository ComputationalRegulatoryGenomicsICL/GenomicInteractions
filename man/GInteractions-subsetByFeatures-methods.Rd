\title{Subset a GInteractions object by features}
\usage{
subsetByFeatures(GIObject, features, feature.class = NULL)

\S4method{subsetByFeatures}{GInteractions,GRanges,missing}(GIObject, features, feature.class = NULL)

\S4method{subsetByFeatures}{GInteractions,GRangesList,missing}(GIObject, features, feature.class = NULL)

\S4method{subsetByFeatures}{GInteractions,character,character}(GIObject, features, feature.class = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{GIObject}{A GInteractions object}

\item{features}{A GRanges or GRangesList object, or a character vector containing
IDs of annotated features, e.g. promoter IDs.}

\item{feature.class}{If `features' is a character vector, the corresponding feature name, e.g. "promoter".}
}
\value{
a subsetted GInteractions object
}
\description{
Subsets interactions for which at least one of the anchors overlaps with a given GRanges object.
Alternatively, subsets interactions based on annotated feature IDs for a particular feature.
}
\examples{
data("hic_example_data")
data("mm9_refseq_promoters")
annotateInteractions(hic_example_data, list(promoter = mm9_refseq_promoters))
ids <- names(mm9_refseq_promoters[1:10])
subsetByFeatures(hic_example_data, ids, "promoter")
}
