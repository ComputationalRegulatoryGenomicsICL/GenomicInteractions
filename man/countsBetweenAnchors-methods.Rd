\usage{
countsBetweenAnchors(x, y, ...)

\S4method{countsBetweenAnchors}{GenomicInteractions,GRanges}(x, y,
  ignore_overlaps = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A GenomicInteractions object}

\item{y}{A GenomicRanges object}

\item{...}{Extra parameters to pass to findOverlaps}

\item{ignore_overlaps}{Allow overlapping anchors. Use this when you have overlapping anchors
but be careful with multi-mapping. The "within" option can help with this.}
}
\value{
A GenomicInteractions object with annotated counts between anchors
}
\description{
Calculate the number of of paired-end reads mapping between a defined set of anchors.
This function will ignore counts present in the input data.
