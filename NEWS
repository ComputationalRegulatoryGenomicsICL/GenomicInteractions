CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.3
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Integration with the new InteractionSet package provides new features including 
  more overlaps methods and conversion to other classes for storing genomic 
  interaction data. See InteractionSet documentation for more details.
  
SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES

* Following InteractionSet integration, distance calculation is done differently 
  and some distances may differ by 1bp.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

* 'annotateAnchors' is deprecated and replaced by 'annotateRegions'.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Import method for reading data from two bam files containing paired end reads.
* A function for removing duplicate interactions: 'removeDups'
* Two methods for finding probable distance cutoffs for self ligations: 
  'get_binom_ligation_threshold' and 'get_self_ligation_threshold'. 
* 'countsBetweenAnchors': a function to summarise interactions between a set of 
  genomic regions of interest.

SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES

* GenomicInteractions objects have been refactored for consistency with GRanges
  objects. Interaction-level metadata such as p-values is now stored as a DataFrame
  accessible using 'mcols'.
* importing data from a file is now done using 'makeGenomicInteractionsFromFile' 
* 'GenomicInteractions' can be used to construct a new object from anchors
  as GRanges objects and metadata.
* 'show' method looks nicer and is faster.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

* 'FDR', 'pValue', 'normalisedCounts', 'genomeName': no longer needed 
  because of refactoring. Access metadata by 'mcols' instead. 
* 'count' renamed to 'interactionCounts'
